This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Will link up with the TicNEToe backend for a playable game.

Front-end *could* do the game logic on its own but wanted to have a proper stack going (and the backend
could do more complicated things down the line).

Just a stripped down framework as of this commit.

## Getting Started

To run just the UI:

```bash
npm run dev
```

# TODO
Move the CI/CD elements (nginx stuff) out of folder, organize it properly.
